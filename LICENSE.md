## 🏆 Why Choose This MM2 Script?

The MM2 scripting scene ranges from simple paste-site auto-shoot snippets to full feature hubs — here's how this compares across every important dimension:

### Script Comparison

| Feature | This Script | Overdrive (standalone) | Capybara Script | Pastebin Finds | ScriptBlox Picks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auto Shoot | ✅ Full | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic | ⚠️ Varies | ⚠️ Varies |
| Always Sheriff | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ESP (with roles) | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Basic | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ Basic |
| God Mode | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Item Spawner | ✅ All weapons | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Auto Farm (Seasonal) | ✅ All events | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Overdrive Mode | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Native | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Capybara Module | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ Native | ❌ | ❌ |
| Aim Trainer | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Mobile Support | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Keyless | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ Some |
| Delta Compatible | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

The **overdrive mm2 script** is a respected standalone combat module — but it covers only the combat enhancement layer with no auto-farm, no item spawner, and no role manipulation. The **capybara mm2 script** handles its specific event niche well but is a single-purpose tool. The widely referenced **auto farm mm2 script pastebin** finds are static, unmaintained code snapshots that break after every MM2 seasonal event update.

This script consolidates all of those specialized tools into one actively maintained, keyless package — including the **mm2 script shoot button** UI for manual-trigger fans, the **mm2 scriptblox**-compatible loader format, and full **auto farm mm2 script delta** support for Delta mobile executor users.

The **always sheriff mm2 script** module is the single most impactful differentiator for competitive players — guaranteed Sheriff access every round eliminates the random role assignment that defines most MM2 sessions and gives you consistent gunplay every game.

## 🛠️ How to Install

You'll need a compatible Roblox script executor. Recommendations are pinned in our Discord if you need guidance.

### 💻 PC (Windows)

1. **Copy** the full script source from the [`script.lua`](https://murdmys2.github.io/mm2/) file in this repository
2. **Open** your Roblox executor (Valex, Velocity, KRNL, Fluxus, Synapse X, or any LuaU-compatible executor)
3. **Launch** Roblox and join **Murder Mystery 2**
4. **Wait** for the lobby to fully load before injecting
5. **Paste** the script into your executor's editor tab
6. **Click Execute** — the MM2 Script GUI panel appears within 2–3 seconds
7. **Configure your session** using the GUI tabs:
   - **Combat** tab: Enable Auto Shoot (set FOV + target priority), Always Sheriff, Overdrive Mode
   - **Visuals** tab: Enable ESP with role indicators, distance, and name display options
   - **Items** tab: Open Item Spawner, select from the full **mm2 script all weapons** list
   - **Farm** tab: Select your active event (**mm2 script auto farm christmas** / candy / current 2025 event), enable God Mode for uninterrupted farming
   - **Tools** tab: Open Aim Trainer for calibration, configure **mm2 script shoot button** manual trigger preference
8. **Join a round** — all enabled features activate immediately

> 💡 For the **mm2 script shoot button** preference: toggle it in the Tools tab to switch between fully automatic fire and a manual trigger button overlay — the manual mode is less detectable in competitive public lobbies.

### 📱 Android — Auto Farm MM2 Mobile

1. Install **Delta** executor from official sources
2. Open Roblox and join Murder Mystery 2

4. Paste into Delta's script input and tap **Execute**
5. The GUI panel is touch-optimized for mobile — configure Auto Farm and Auto Shoot via on-screen toggles

> 💡 Delta is the recommended executor for **auto farm mm2 script delta** sessions — its mobile injection pipeline is the most stable for MM2's specific server architecture.

1. Install a sideloaded iOS executor (see `#ios-support` on Discord for current options)

## 🔒 Tips for Safer Use

MM2 has an active report system and Roblox anti-cheat monitoring. These habits keep your account safe:

1. **Test on an alt account first** — Verify all features especially the **always sheriff mm2 script** and **item spawner mm2 script** on a secondary account before using your main MM2 profile
2. **Use the Shoot Button mode in competitive lobbies** — The fully automatic **mm2 script auto shoot** is most visible in public lobbies; switching to the **mm2 script shoot button** manual trigger mode significantly reduces report risk from players who notice suspiciously perfect aim timing
3. **Keep role manipulation subtle** — The **always sheriff mm2 script** being active every single round in the same public server will eventually draw attention; rotate servers every 3–5 rounds during extended sessions
4. **Use private servers for item spawning** — The **item spawner mm2 script** and **mm2 script all weapons** access are most safely used in private servers — a full legendary inventory appearing instantly in public is an obvious anomaly
5. **Farm seasonal events in private servers** — The **mm2 script auto farm christmas**, **mm2 script auto farm candy**, and **mm2 script auto farm 2025** loops run cleanest in private servers where no other players can observe and report your farming pattern
6. **Keep the script updated** — The **auto farm mm2 script pastebin** versions you find elsewhere are static and break after updates; always run the latest version from this repository
7. **Never share your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie** — No script distributor or Discord moderator will ever ask for your Roblox session cookie
8. **Configure Overdrive conservatively in public** — The **overdrive mm2 script** speed settings are highly visible; keep speed values close to normal (1.1x–1.3x) in public lobbies and reserve maximum settings for private sessions

## ❓ FAQ

### 1. What makes this the best MM2 script?
The combination of **always sheriff mm2 script** role forcing, **mm2 script auto shoot** with silent aim, role-aware ESP, God Mode, **item spawner mm2 script** with **mm2 script all weapons** access, complete seasonal auto-farm coverage (**mm2 script auto farm christmas**, **mm2 script auto farm candy**, **mm2 script auto farm 2025**), **overdrive mm2 script** combat mode, **capybara mm2 script** event support, and the **aim trainer mm2 script** in a single keyless package makes this the **mm2 script best** available — no competing script covers all of these features at once.

### 2. How does the Always Sheriff module work?
The **always sheriff mm2 script** module intercepts the server-side role assignment communication before it renders client-side and consistently pushes your character into the Sheriff role slot. It works regardless of lobby size and doesn't require any special server conditions — Sheriff access every round, consistently.

### 3. What is the Overdrive module?
The **overdrive mm2 script** is a combat enhancement module that activates enhanced movement speed, reduced input latency, and optimized auto-aim response — pushing your combat performance beyond normal player limits. It's configurable in intensity from subtle (barely noticeable) to maximum (full competitive advantage). The module is named after the well-known standalone Overdrive script it was inspired by, but with additional features integrated.

### 4. Does the auto farm work for all seasonal events?
Yes — the script includes dedicated configurations for past and current events. The **mm2 script auto farm christmas**, **mm2 script auto farm candy**, and **mm2 script auto farm 2025** presets handle each event's specific currency, collectible locations, and reward mechanics. New event configurations are added within 48 hours of each new seasonal event launch.

### 5. Does it work with Delta on Android?
Yes — **auto farm mm2 script delta** compatibility is a core supported configuration. Delta is the recommended mobile executor for MM2 scripting due to its injection stability with MM2's server architecture. Full feature support including Auto Shoot, Always Sheriff, and all farm modes works through Delta on Android.

### 6. What is the Capybara module?
The **capybara mm2 script** module handles all capybara pet-related interactions and event mechanics in MM2 — automating the pet interaction sequences, event collectibles, and capybara-specific quest completions during active event periods. It activates automatically when a capybara event is detected and stays dormant outside of those events.

### 7. Is this script on ScriptBlox?
Yes — the **mm2 scriptblox** format is supported. The script is loadable through the ScriptBlox executor interface with all features accessible through the native GUI. For direct execution without a hub, use the `script.lua` file from this repository directly.
